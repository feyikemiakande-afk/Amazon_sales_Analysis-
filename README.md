# Amazon Sales Performance Analysis – Business & Data Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyses Amazon sales data to monitor business performance, identify trends, and support investigation of sales and fulfilment outcomes. An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to enable stakeholders to explore sales patterns across products, time periods, shipping locations, and order status.

---

## Business Problem
Sales performance and order outcomes are traditionally reviewed retrospectively using static reports, limiting stakeholders ability to proactively identify declining trends or understand the drivers behind order cancellations. This results in reactive decision making and delayed corrective actions.

---

## Objective
To design an interactive, self-service Power BI dashboard that supports:
- Monitoring of key sales KPIs  
- Investigation of sales trends and declines  
- Analysis of order outcomes (delivered vs cancelled)  
- Faster and more structured business analysis  

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains Amazon sales information, including:
- Order ID and order date  
- Revenue and quantity sold  
- Product categories and sizes  
- Shipping city and state  
- Order and ship status 

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- DAX (basic measures)  
- Data modeling  
- Data visualization and dashboard design  

---

## Analysis Performed
- Cleaned and modelled raw sales data for analysis  
- Created KPIs for total sales, quantity sold, and average order value
 -`DAX
  Total Sales =
   SUM ( Sales[Sales_Amount] )`
- Analysed monthly sales trends to identify seasonality and declines  
- Compared performance by product category, size, city, and state  
- Enabled interactive exploration through slicers and filters  

---

## Core KPIs
- Total Sales  
- Total Quantity Sold  
- Average Order Value (AOV)  
- Monthly Sales Trend  

---

## Exploratory Analysis Approach


---

## Exploratory Questions
- Which products and regions contribute the most to total sales?
- How do sales and order volumes vary over time?
- Are there noticeable seasonal or peak-period trends?
- Which product categories experience higher cancellation rates?
- How does performance change when different filters are applied?


### Baseline View 
Sales trends and order outcomes are reviewed retrospectively using static reports, with limited ability to drill into contributing factors behind sales declines or order cancellations.

### Interactive View 
 filtering enables deeper exploration across products, locations, time periods, and order status, supporting faster, more structured, and insight driven analysis, and revelaing trend outliers

## Key Findings
- Total sales of approximately **$76.03M** across **100,000+ units sold**  
- Medium sized products generated the highest revenue  
- Majority of sales were generated by the product set, grossing a total of over **$37M**
- Sales peak in **April**, followed by a gradual decline in subsequent months
- Customers placed orders of teh Set items, which were worth **3M**, but got cancelledd 
- Revenue is concentrated in a limited number of key cities and states  
- Order status filtering enables targeted analysis of delivered and cancelled orders  

---

## How the Dashboard Is Used
- Monitor overall sales performance through KPIs  
- Analyse monthly trends per variable 
- Compare product and geographic performance  
- Investigate order cancellations and fulfilment outcomes  
- Support discussions around inventory planning, marketing strategy, and operations  

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Business problem framing
- Data cleaning and modelling  
- KPI definition and metric design  
- Dashboard design for business users  
- Translating data into actionable business insights  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Power BI dashboards can support effective business analysis by combining KPIs, interactive filtering, and analytical thinking to enable structured exploration of sales performance and operational outcomes.
